We received a password reset request for your email address on {{ .Operator }}
Supernode, but there is no account with such email address on this server. If
you did not request the password reset, then please ignore this email.  If you
did, then perhaps you used a different email address for your account on this
server, or perhaps you have an account on a different supernode.
